# **Welcome to Eventor**

Eventor is a phone and web based application for introverted and indecisive people to help them decide what to do on a night out. It nicely displays a map when you have the option to search for the city anywhere in the world to go to. Once you have the city you have 3 different categories for fun - Restaurants, Hotels and Entertainment. Once a catergory and a destination have been set the app will display all of the information on the page with photos, ratings, websites, addresses and weather in the local area.

## **Getting Started**

For my original idea I wanted to create a CRUD app only designed for web browsers where the user would create and account or sign in to an existing account, they would then be directed to a page where there is a button that when clicked would display a random restaurant or palce to get food for the user to go to. If the user enjoyed their experience they would save the restaurant and could revist previous places they had gone to.

## Idea Number 2 

Given the previous projects that I have qorked on I decided to put my skills to the test and change what I was going to do. I decided that I wanted to make an application that was more user friendly and visually appealing. I decide to make the back-end and database set up a stretch goal and make a front-end based application.

This idea would remain in the same concept of randomly generating a restaurant for someone to discover but have the restaurant pull infromation from an API to display the address, reviews and a map of the location. I was also considering using Material UI or Bootstrap for the styling of the application. Given this was going to be a user friendly application I knew I wanted to use React to ensure that the application was interactive.
